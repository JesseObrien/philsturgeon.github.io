Finally got around to finishing off a small app I was working on a few weeks back. I forgot to finish it off until yesterday, so here it is.

Find out how you can save money upgrading your iPhone contract with o2. You could save yourself £400 just by waiting 2 months! If you have the right criteria, you could even make a profit on the upgrade.

Answer the questions to find out how much money you could save just by waiting a few months to upgrade.

None of the information is stored, I really could not care less about who has what contract at the moment. This was done just to help people dodge o2's horrendous buyout fee's.
