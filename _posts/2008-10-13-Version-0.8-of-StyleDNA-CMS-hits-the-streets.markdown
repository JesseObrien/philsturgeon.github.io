New in this version of the CMS is:

- Permission system (still got some work to do, but will restrict users by module/controller/method).
- Re-organized navigation to get rid of tab clutter.
- Fixed .htaccess to allow clean url's.
- Added option to send activation emails or not.
- Cleaned up lots of the CSS and stripped out unused code.  

- Impoved news module.
- Improved interface in most module admin sections.  

There's a bunch of other changes I can't really remember, and many that aren't worth a mention. All-in-all this is a damn good release and im glad the CMS is getting so close to being complete.

As always, the latest version is online on the [demo site](http://demo.styledna.net/ "demo site").

Special thanks to [MrEnirO](http://codeigniter.com/forums/member/44710/) as always for his huge contributions to this CMS.
