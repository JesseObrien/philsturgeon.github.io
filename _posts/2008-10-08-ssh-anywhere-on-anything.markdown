Using AJAX based [consoleFISH](https://www.serfish.com/console/ "consoleFISH") you can log into any server via SSH and have full access to your site over this funky emulated bash terminal. It's so effective I managed to fix the news admin panel for this site (so I could post this article) in less than a minute.  
  
  
It has a very new version of vim and colours files, text and syntax just like normal.  
  
  
The downsides however are quite large. There is a captcha that contains obscure badly displayed words that kicks in roughly every 45 seconds unless you 3 euro's a month. Then there's the tin-hat crowd who I am sure will not like the idea of sending ssh passwords (especially server root logins) to a third party.  
  
  
These downsides are for you to weigh up, but if you have no other way to access SSH, this could be a very handy tool.  
  
  
Let me know what scrapes this service has got you out of.
