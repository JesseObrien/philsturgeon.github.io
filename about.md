I've been programming since I was about 12, writing awful messes in spaghetti PHP. 14 years later and I have learned how to a) program in languages other than PHP and b) make PHP be a better place to be. I code, I train, I teach, I write and I speak, all about the random technical things I have been up to recently with PHP, API development and more recently a whole boat-load of devops.

I love to explore new technologies, try new methodologies, and keep building bigger and better things. Luckily my new job with [Ride] lets me do a lot of that, and I've turned into a huge fan of Go.
